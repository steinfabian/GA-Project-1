This application enables users to customise swimwear, create, view and edit their customer account, and submit an order to the database.

rails 4.1.5
ruby 2.0.0p481 (2014-05-08 revision 45883) [x86_64-linux]

Commands:
bundle
rake db:create
rake db:migrate
rake db:seed

Before deploying it to heroku also run this command in the console, otherwise the bootstrap CSS will most likely not be considered by heroku:
bundle exec rake assets:precompile
